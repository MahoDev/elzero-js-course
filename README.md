This repository records my journey taking Osama Elzero's [JavaScript YouTube course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAx3kiplQR_oeDqLDBUDYwVv).

I started the course on 2023/2/3 and managed to finish it on 2023/6/30. So it took about 5 months.
However, as you can see from the commit history, there were periods of months in which I couldn't study the course due to being busy.
Because of that, I am sure anyone who is free, organized and hard working enough can finish the course in much shorter time.
